//! - `--r-input: 6px` (:54)                 the frame corner
//! - `--accent: rgb(31,117,219)` (:20)      the focus border
//! - `--danger: rgb(255,123,123)` (:22)     the error border
//! - `--text: #fff` (:24)                   the text and caret colour
//! - `.text-input { border: 1px solid transparent }` (:167)  idle has no visible border
//! - `.text-input:focus { border-color: accent; box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px accent }` (:169)
